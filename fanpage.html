    <p id="description"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mayer">John Clayton Mayer</a> was born on October 16th
      1977 in the small town of Fairfield,
      Conneticut. His parents were to two Collegiate educators Richard and Margaret Mayer. At an early age, John had a
      facination with music eventually finding his way to a guitar and a bunch of Stevie Ray Vaughan tapes. In high school
      he was in and out of numerous blues and rock bands, eventually finding himself going to <a
        href="https://www.berklee.edu/">Berklee College of Music</a>
      when it was time for College. He spent one semester at Berklee before begging his parents to let him drop out and
      move to Atlanta to pursue a career. Once he moved to Atlanta he collaborated with another musician <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_Cook">Clay Cook</a> and
      began to play shows and write music together. After a short year John parted ways with Clay and focused on building
      his own career. He played at the SXSW Music Festival in Atlanta 2001, he was signed to Aware Records, and then soon
      after Columbia Records. John since then has went on to create numerous multi-platinum singles and albums. Currently,
